# EmbedAI

**EmbedAI** is a lightweight and modular artificial intelligence framework designed specifically for embedded systems, edge devices, and constrained IoT environments.

> 💡 Powering intelligence where it's needed most — at the edge.

## Overview

In a world where intelligence is no longer confined to the cloud, **EmbedAI** enables AI computation directly on edge devices. Whether it's a smart sensor, wearable, microcontroller, or custom embedded system, EmbedAI brings inference to where data is born — enabling faster decisions, lower latency, and improved privacy.

Built with efficiency and minimalism in mind, **EmbedAI** is written in C and designed to be highly portable, hardware-agnostic, and easy to integrate into bare-metal or RTOS-based systems. No external dependencies. No unnecessary bloat. Just clean, scalable AI.

## Why EmbedAI?

- ⚡ **Minimal Footprint**  
  Designed to run on devices with limited RAM and CPU resources.

- 🧠 **Neural Network Core**  
  Supports dense layers, activation functions, and tensor operations.

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**  
  Core components are decoupled and extensible, making it easy to add new layer types or backend optimizations.

- 🔒 **Privacy First**  
  All inference happens on-device — your data never leaves the hardware.

- 🌍 **Made for the Real World**  
  Tested for use in wearables, edge cameras, industrial sensors, and low-power MCUs. EmbedAI is built for environments where every byte and cycle counts.

## Project Status

EmbedAI is currently in active early-stage development. Core features such as tensor operations and fully-connected (Dense) layers are implemented. Inference is functional and being tested on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi.

Stay tuned — future releases will include support for:

- Activation layers (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.)
- Model serialization
- Quantization-aware inference
- Hardware acceleration backends
- TinyML compatibility
